# Pokemon Memory Card Game
This is just a standard Memory Card Game with Pokemon theme ðŸŽ‰
I use the images of the Pokemon from [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) Public API for Pokemon data.

## Upcoming Feature ðŸŽ‰
In this game I will develop some features which are:
* Login
* Register
* Setting
* Leaderboard

## Technology
I only use vanilla [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
I use a build tool named [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compress and minify my [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) in order to make the Website running smoothly.
At this time I'm still learning to use that tool.
